# BTC-Mobile

BTC-Mobile is an innovative fork of Bitcoin designed to optimize blockchain technology for mobile devices and international communication. By increasing the block size to 2MB and reducing the block time to 2 minutes, BTC-Mobile enhances transaction throughput and reduces confirmation times, making it ideal for modern mobile-first users. Leveraging advanced AI and ML techniques, decentralized storage solutions like IPFS, and over 88 open-source communication protocols, BTC-Mobile aims to bring Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash to the next generation of users.

## Introduction

BTC-Mobile is designed to address the evolving needs of the Bitcoin community, focusing on mobile optimization, transaction speed, and enhanced security. This project aims to make Bitcoin more accessible and efficient for mobile devices while ensuring secure and decentralized transactions.

## Features

- **Increased Block Size and Reduced Block Time**: Block size increased to 2MB and block time reduced to 2 minutes, enhancing transaction throughput and reducing confirmation times.
- **Simplified Payment Verification (SPV)**: Lightweight nodes for mobile devices to participate in the network without downloading the entire blockchain.
- **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized storage for enhanced data availability and reduced reliance on centralized servers.
- **AI and ML Integration**: Optimizations for various communication protocols, including HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, MQTT, CoAP, and many others, ensuring efficient and reliable communication.
- **Support for 88+ Communication Protocols**: Facilitates seamless international transactions and global interoperability.
- **Satellite Communication (SatCom)**: Ensures users in remote and underserved areas can participate in the Bitcoin network.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/btc-mobile.git
    cd btc-mobile
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
